# DAOs

This repository includes simulation codes for governance issue especially for Decentralization Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), which will be memorized as Large World Network, compared to [Small World Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network).


The simulation model follows the research stream of [Exploration and Exploitation in Organization Learning](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.2.1.71) by James G March on Organization Science in 1991, and [Balancing Exploration and Exploitation Through Structural Design: The Isolation of Subgroups and Organizational Learning](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/orsc.1090.0468) by Christina Fang on Organization Science in 2010.
